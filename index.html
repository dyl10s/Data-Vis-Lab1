                <p>
                    The data set I will be using is from the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). I will be looking at all the failed banks from October 13th, 2000 to November 1st, 2019. With this data I will be looking to see if there are major outlier states that
                    have a lot of bank failures as well as seeing if the location of the state effects how many banks fail.

                            The chart above shows the breakdown of states and the number of banks that have failed in each one. This allows you to easily view each individual states and their exact number of failed banks.

                        <p>
                            The second chart to the left gives you a heatmap of the number of failed banks. Black states have 0 or very few failed banks, and the red states have the most.

                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        Overall, I think after doing this lab I feel like more data from other sources would be helpful. One of the main questions is how many banks are in each state. Although states like Illinois, Georgia and Florida seem to stick out more then the others it
                        makes me wonder if thoughts states just have more banks in general. The geo-chart did provide me with an interesting bit of information that didn't really cross my mind when looking at the details in the bar chart. 2 of the 3 states
                        that had the large outliers of failures are right next to each other. My one wild guess about maybe why the stats in the south south-east have a high rate of failure is because thatâ€™s where a lot of people pick to retire. I wonder
                        if there is so much competition in these states that a lot of banks just come and go. The filters also provided some cool information. Recently there have not actually been to many bank failures but back around 2010 it seemed to
                        be very bad.
